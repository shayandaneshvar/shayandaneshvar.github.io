                    I'm a student, researcher and engineer with over 4 years of
                    experience in software engineering. I have worked
                    as a developer, researcher, and architect on various academic and enterprise
                    projects, including chat, wallet management and payment, E-commerce
                    big data, distributed computing, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and android
                    solutions in B2B and B2C markets.
                </p>
                <p>

                    I am genuinely interested in <strong>Software Engineering, Distributed Architectures, Big Data, Data Mining,
                    Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, and Computer Vision</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am and have always been eager to learn about new subjects especially when they are complex or
                    require a lot of mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current goal is to go to a top-ranking university and learn more about one or more of my
                    interests, and do serious research and be a worthy contributor to Science and Computer Science.</p>
                <p>
                    Like all other software engineers and computer scientists, I have the working knowledge of various
                    programming languages and platforms. However, I have been using Java and Python more than other languages, and
                    Tensorflow and Spring Framework more than other frameworks.

            <p>
                Gozar is a multi-factor authentication solution on mobile phones. It
                can be used as the second-factor or the second and third factor or
                password-less biometric authentication. There are other solutions in
                the market, but Gozar is different. Gozar does not use one-time
                passwords (OTP) like others. It uses asynchronous cryptography known
                as public key/private key and digital signature and employs the
                smartphone's secure element, a cryptography chip, to store keys and
                perform cryptographic operations. Gozar combines the secure element
                with biometric verification to authenticate users. In addition,
                Gozar provides a feature called "blind authentication," which does
                not send the usernames outside of the customer system. So, Gozar
                authenticates a user while does not know the username at all. I
                developed the Android and iOS of this product using ReactNative. I
                love serverless architecture, so Gozar is developed in NodeJS and
                served by Google Firebase and NoSQL database. The dashboard is a
                React project.

            <p>
                Slap.n.Pay is a new way to shop online and pay securely and easily.
                Slap.n.Pay transforms your smartphone to a personal mobile PoS
                (Point-of-Sale) in your hand. You do not need to enter your credit
                card number, CVV, and billing address on online websites anymore.
                Just press the Slap.n.Pay button on the supported online website and
                pay on your smartphone by tapping your card to your phone.
                Slap.n.Pay uses NFC technology on your smartphone and credit card to
                create a convenient way for hassle-free payment. I developed this
                project with serverless architecture. We created a startup company
                to raise funds or establish a partnership with a well-known payment
                company. We also filed a family of patents for this product.

            <p>
                It is a new secure hardware crypto wallet that supports
                cryptographic backup and super-wallet/sub-wallet. It was initially
                my Ph.D. project for 4 years, and you can find its published papers
                in the publication section. Then, I made it a product and started to
                create a startup company. I developed the cryptography code for
                smart (IC) chips using JavaCard technologies. Actually, I wrote
                micro-controller codes in a Java-like language and compiled them to
                run on Java Card Runtime Environment (JCRE). I did it on simulation
                and several real chips from various manufactures. In this project, I
                also used ePaper technology as a secure, trusted display on the
                card. I used ReactNative to create the Android and iOS apps and my
                crafted native codes for the cryptography part. XebaWallet uses the
                smartphone NFC antenna to communicate with a smart (IC) chip on a
                credit card for cryptography. The backup procedure of this project
                is new and unique. You clone a hardware wallet to another hardware
                wallet with a crafted cryptography protocol, and no hacker can
                intercept it. It is very secure and user-friendly since the user
                does not need a complex paper backup with many words and potential
                risks to expose.

            <p>
                HyperReader is a new way to use smart cards anytime and anywhere. It
                transforms the smartphone into an NFC card reader to use ISO/IEC
                7816 and 14443 compatible chips. So, a company can use HyperReader
                to read smart cards like credit cards, ID cards, or travel documents
                remotely. I developed this product using ReactNative and my native
                modules to communicate with the NFC antenna and perform
                cryptographic operations. It provides APIs that a customer uses to
                run smart (IC) card commands remotely. It gets a JavaScript-like
                code and runs it as a smart card script on the user's mobile phone!
                If you know the smart card industry, you know there are a lot of
                applications for it. ;-)

            <p>
                This is a tool to connect web pages to smart cards via javascript.
                This tool works with all ISO7816/14443 and NFC smart cards.
                smartcardPage is a demo page to demonstrate how to use
                smartcardBridge. With this utility, you can send APDU commands and
                receive APDU responses to/from all ISO7816/14443 and NFC smart
                cards. It also supports jCardSim as a java card simulator with a
                simple REST server. You may use smartcardBridge to share smart cards
                between different virtual machines (VM) and share a smart card on a
                network. Since developing a smart (IC) card program is challenging
                and gets a lot of time and knowledge, many Ph.D. students do not try
                it. It is very cool and valuable for cryptography researchers
                studying cryptography, blockchain, payment systems, security
                dongles, security elements, etc. So, I developed SmartcardPage to
                make smart card testing easy for Ph.D. students and academic
                research labs. A student just needs to have a card reader and open
                this page to communicate with a smart card:

                This is a Java Card Applet implementation as a proof-of-concept of
                my proposed technique to secure the digital sign process in a smart
                card. You can find project details in the attached paper in PDF
                format. I used a proposed method called "one-time scanning" to
                decode DER and TLV format inside the smart card with limited
                resources and performance. My test results demonstrate that this new
                technique works well for a smart card. In this project, you can find
                a decoder for digital certificate, timestamp token, certificate
                revocation list (CLR). Actually, you can use the TLV engine to
                decode every DER-encoded content inside the smart card. You must
                define a template for your content, and then you can decode it in
                the card. There are two different versions of the TLV decoder in the
                source code: TLV and TLV2. The file "TLV.java" is the classic
                version of the TLV decoder, which is fully dynamic and can decode
                all DER-encoded content but is slow in the smart card. The file
                "TLV2.java" is the faster version that uses a one-time scanning
                technique. I used hard-coded 1024 and 2048 RSA keys to test the
                proposed protocol, and if you like real-world keys, you must change
                hard-coded keys with new commands to generate RSA keys on the card.

            ><strong>LedgerNanoS Hack</strong></a
            ><br/>
            <p>
                It is a try to reverse engineer the Ledger Nano S that is the best
                existing Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) Hardware Wallet in the
                market. Ledger Live.exe is the desktop application to manage Ledger
                Nano S. It is an Electron application based on NodeJs. It uses the
                "node-hid" library to access HID devices. On the other hand, Ledger
                Nano S has a Secure Element to store the master seed and private
                keys. This secure element is a smart card chip that communicates
                using APDU messages. For reverse engineering, Wireshark is enough to
                monitor USB messages and extract transferred APDUs. Still, if I want
                to modify them and make a Man-In-The-Middle attack, I need to
                develop some hacking code, and this project is that! This code uses
                EasyHook to inject two fake functions into LedgerLive.exe address
                space, including CreateFileA and WriteFile. CreateFileA opens the
                HID device, and WriteFile sends USB messages that include APDU to
                the device. In this hack, I get the HID device handle by injecting
                my code into the CreateFileA function and modify transferred APDUs
                by injecting my code into the WriteFile function. As a result, I
                could intercept APDUs between LedgerLive.exe and Ledger Nano S
                device and alter them as a Man-In-The-Middle attack. Because
                LedgeLive.exe is a NodeJs app, it runs inside that and creates four
                processes. So, "injectorApp" finds all and injects hack code to
                them. Still, only the correct one is hacked by checking the FilePath
                in the CreateFileA call. You can use this project to experiment with
                Ledger Nano S and maybe other USB Hardware Wallets.

                It is a spyware tool for sniffing a user's PIN and altering its
                digital signature in PIV smart card on Microsoft Windows. After
                compiling the project, you must replace Windows original
                'msclmd.dll' with the compiled DLL of this project with the same
                name. To test the DLL, you must have a PIV smart card like
                <a href="https://pivkey.com/" target="_blank">PIV Key</a> or
                <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank">YubiKey</a>. Use
                your smart card or token to log in to your Windows or run a program
                that uses your YubiKey or PIV smart card. When you enter your
                token's password (PIN), a popup window displays your PIN, which is
                sniffed from DLL. A hacker can use the same technique to steal your
                YubiKey or PIV smart card password. Obviously, I used C++ and
                low-level Windows operating system functions to develop this
                project.
