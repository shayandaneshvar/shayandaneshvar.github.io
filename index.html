                <p>
                    I'm a student, researcher and engineer with over 4 years of
                    experience in software engineering. I have worked
                    as a developer, researcher, and architect on various academic and enterprise
                    projects, including chat, wallet management and payment, E-commerce,
                    big data, distributed computing, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and android
                    solutions in B2B and B2C markets.
                </p>
                <p>

                    I am genuinely interested in <strong>Software Engineering, Distributed Architectures, Big Data, Data
                    Mining,
                    Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, and Computer Vision</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am and have always been eager to learn about new subjects especially when they are complex or
                    require a lot of mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current goal is to go to a top-ranking university and learn more about one or more of my
                    interests, and do serious research and be a worthy contributor to Science and Computer Science.</p>
                <p>
                    Like all other software engineers and computer scientists, I have the working knowledge of various
                    programming languages and platforms. However, I have been using Java and Python more than other
                    languages, and
                    Tensorflow and Spring Framework more than other frameworks.

            PCA, SVD, Linear and Log-Linear Regression algorithms in Java Android; created a dataset of three different
            barcodes with different purposes and for three different research papers; trained three CNNs with these
            datasets on Tensorflow, and transferred the TF model to TF Lite to use in Android. (I will share all the
            details (and the datasets) after submission of all of these papers.)

                    In this project, I had to build and train a deep learning model that could remove or decrease the
                    effect of the reflections of in-vehicle images in a way that the end result would look natural.
                    First, I used a dataset of real-world streets and road images (from CamVid dataset) and synthesized
                    a new dataset with reflections of various objects. Then, I came up with a CNN that
                    resembled the original U-Net neural network but with 3-channels for each pixel in the output.
                    Finally, I trained various similar networks with different depths and kernel sizes to get to the
                    final solution which could remove most reflections and restore the original image section behind
                    the reflection.

                    In this project, my friend and I had to take various pictures of our selves, find the face landmarks
                    with dlib library, and calculate the average face. Then, we had to register the faces to the
                    average. We had to transfer the photos using an affine and similarity matrix transform.
                    <br>
                    In the second phase, we calculated the principal components (PCA) using Singular Value Decomposition

                    In the third phase, we had to transfer webcam image's gesture to each other's face model (By finding

                    In this project, I had to detect, and classify soccer players and the referees, and finally draw
                    them with 3 colors on an artificial soccer field.
                    <br>
                    In order to detect soccer players, I used KNN background subtraction algorithm alongside basic
                    morphology techniques and the connected component algorithm. In order to classify them, I created a
                    dataset of players and referees and trained a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
                    The final model reached an accuracy of over 98%. The whole project was fast enough to detect,
                    classify, and visualize players and referees in a smooth fashion (10 fps on a mid-range laptop).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also used a transform to get the exact location on a birds-eye view field. (I had to connect
                    footage of three video cameras, and I chose to use a transform instead of creating a panorama image)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to make calculations faster, I tried to use motion estimation algorithms, like optical
                    flow, and skip a few frame on the original video, but it was not very successful. (So, the final
                    code repository does not contain the code of this part!)

                    In this project, I had to find an interesting problem and solve it with Genetic Algorithm, Genetic
                    Programming, and a Multi Objective Optimization Algorithm without using any Genetic or Optimization
                    Algorithm libraries. I chose Text Summarization problem as I had heard about it in a previous course
                    (Fundamentals of Speech and Natural Language Processing), and chose NSGA-II as the second algorithm.
                    <br>
                    I implemented all three algorithms in Java utilizing OOP, and used two criteria for optimization
                    which were less similar sentences, and higher sentence scores.

                    The results for NSGA-II were very promising that the course instructor offered me a research
                    assistant opportunity to optimize it a little more, and publish it as a new fast genetic method for
                    text summarization. <small>(Sadly, I couldn't accept as I was busy working as a research assistant,
                    teaching assistant, and software developer at the same time!)</small>

                    In this project, I developed a full monolith website with Spring Framework, Spring Data, Spring
                    Security, Java, MongoDB, MongoDB GridFS, JS, CSS, HTML, and Thymeleaf.
                    You could upload and download your files anytime you wanted, and you could share the files with
                    another person via email or shared its link.
                    It was deployed and was available at kbox.shayandaneshvar.ir for over 3 months.
                    It can be deployed easily to production anytime.

                    This project is basically a website where people could take tests in various subjects, mostly in
                    Software Engineering, and find out which topics they need to learn better.
                    Also, the admins could upload videos with different titles in various topics (Both free and paid),
                    where users could pay to watch a video and strengthen their skills.
                    I was responsible for the design, development, and deployment of the backend services, and one of my
                    friends was responsible for UI/UX design and development of the website.
                    Sadly, no sponsors were found and the project got cancelled. (So, if you are interested in the
                    source code, just give me an email.) Services that got completed or reached the MVP: Video Service, Auth Service, and Quiz Service.

                                In this project, we could build any sort of software we wanted. Hence, three other people and I decided to build a photo sharing sort of website.
                                I was responsible for the backend design, development, and deployment.
                                <br>
                                I also helped one of my friends develop two recommender systems for the website (A Categorical Filtering Recommender and A Collaborative Filtering Recommender).
                                I also helped my frontend developer friends use Angular's Auth Guard and save JWT on user's local storage, and developed the login page.
                                The project has a Microservices Architecture and is consisted of the following services: Auth(N/Z) and OAuth Service, User Service, Service Discovery Server, Gateway Service (Zuul v1), Photo Service, and an Externalized Configuration service.
                                The backend code is over 12K Lines of Java code alongside over 2K lines of configurations, dockerfiles, etc.
