                <p>
                    I'm a student, researcher and engineer with over 4 years of
                    experience in software engineering. I have worked
                    as a developer, researcher, and architect on various academic and enterprise
                    projects, including chat, wallet management and payment, E-commerce
                    big data, distributed computing, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and android
                    solutions in B2B and B2C markets.
                </p>
                <p>

                    I am genuinely interested in <strong>Software Engineering, Distributed Architectures, Big Data, Data Mining,
                    Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, and Computer Vision</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am and have always been eager to learn about new subjects especially when they are complex or
                    require a lot of mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current goal is to go to a top-ranking university and learn more about one or more of my
                    interests, and do serious research and be a worthy contributor to Science and Computer Science.</p>
                <p>
                    Like all other software engineers and computer scientists, I have the working knowledge of various
                    programming languages and platforms. However, I have been using Java and Python more than other languages, and
                    Tensorflow and Spring Framework more than other frameworks.

            <p>
                Gozar is a multi-factor authentication solution on mobile phones. It
                can be used as the second-factor or the second and third factor or
                password-less biometric authentication. There are other solutions in
                the market, but Gozar is different. Gozar does not use one-time
                passwords (OTP) like others. It uses asynchronous cryptography known
                as public key/private key and digital signature and employs the
                smartphone's secure element, a cryptography chip, to store keys and
                perform cryptographic operations. Gozar combines the secure element
                with biometric verification to authenticate users. In addition,
                Gozar provides a feature called "blind authentication," which does
                not send the usernames outside of the customer system. So, Gozar
                authenticates a user while does not know the username at all. I
                developed the Android and iOS of this product using ReactNative. I
                love serverless architecture, so Gozar is developed in NodeJS and
                served by Google Firebase and NoSQL database. The dashboard is a
                React project.
